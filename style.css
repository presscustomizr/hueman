* The main css stylesheet of the Hueman theme is located in /assets/front/css/main.css.

* The main reason why the main stylesheet of the Hueman theme has been moved to another place is minification.
* Minification is a technique to compress a css file and therefore improve speed (page load time) of your website.

* This style.css file provides details about the Theme (in the form of comments above) that is read by WordPress, and therefore cannot be minified.

* Note : You can load the not minified stylesheet if you uncheck the option in the customizer > Advanced Options > performances

* Developers Recommendation
* If you want to make quick style test / changes, consider using the Custom CSS section in Appearance > customize > advanced options > Additional CSS.
* It will persist on update since it is saved in your server database.
*
* To make important CSS customizations, you'll want to use a child theme and add your css code in the style.css file of it.
* You should NEVER add your custom css rules to this file. They will be lost when updating your theme.

* If you don't know what a child theme is, you really want to spend 5 minutes learning how to use child themes in WordPress, you won't regret it :) !
